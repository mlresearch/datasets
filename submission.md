Submissions are in the form of a markdown file to be created at the following location:

```_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-authorsurnameYYa.md```

We provide a stub file there for editing. Please update the name of the file withe date of the submission in YYYY-MM-DD form and the correct author surname.

Inside the file you will find fields for providing the data download URL location. We do not host the data directly on the DMLR site. You will need to find a secure way to host the data for long term availability.

Your submission should contain instructions on how to load in the data, provided in code form. For the moment we are restricting code to python only.

Any installations required must also be provided.

At least one simple task for the data should be described, with a simple implementation (again, for the moment in Python code only). 

Review will consist of a check on the ability to load the data, the ability to carry out the task.
